<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Membrane Oxygenator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flat Sheet Membrane Oxygenator</li><li>Hollow Fibre Membrane Oxygenator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Membrane oxygenators are devices used in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to oxygenate and remove carbon dioxide from blood outside the body. There are two main types of membrane oxygenators: flat sheet membrane oxygenators and hollow fibre membrane oxygenators. Flat sheet membrane oxygenators use a thin, flat membrane to exchange gases, while hollow fibre membrane oxygenators use a bundle of hollow fibres. Both types are used in medical settings for patients requiring respiratory or cardiac support.</p></p>
