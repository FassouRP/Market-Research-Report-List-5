<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peripheral Vascular Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon-expandable</li><li>Self-expandable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Peripheral vascular stents are devices used to treat blocked blood vessels in the arms, legs, or other parts of the body. There are two main types of peripheral vascular stents on the market: balloon-expandable and self-expandable stents. Balloon-expandable stents are placed in the blocked artery and then expanded using a balloon catheter, while self-expandable stents are designed to expand on their own once inserted into the artery. Both types of stents help to improve blood flow and reduce symptoms of peripheral artery disease.</p></p>
