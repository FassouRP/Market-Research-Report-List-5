<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Valve Frame Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Valve</li><li>Biological Tissue Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Heart Valve Frame Market consists of two main types: Mechanical Valves and Biological Tissue Valves. Mechanical valves are made of durable materials such as metal or carbon, and are designed to last a lifetime. Biological Tissue Valves, on the other hand, are made from animal tissues such as bovine or porcine valves. While Mechanical Valves have a longer lifespan, Biological Tissue Valves are less likely to cause blood clots and may not require lifelong medication. Each type has its own advantages and considerations for patients.</p></p>
