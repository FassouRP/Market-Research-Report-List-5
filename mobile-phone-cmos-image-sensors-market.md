<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mobile Phone CMOS Image Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stacked CMOS</li><li>Back-illuminated CMOS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mobile phone CMOS Image Sensors come in two main types: Stacked CMOS and Back-illuminated CMOS. Stacked CMOS technology involves stacking the pixel array on top of the analog signal processing circuitry, allowing for higher pixel densities and improved performance. On the other hand, Back-illuminated CMOS sensors have the photodiodes placed closer to the surface, resulting in increased sensitivity to light and improved image quality, especially in low-light conditions. Both technologies are crucial for enhancing the performance of mobile phone cameras.</p></p>
