<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multi-Factor Authentication Smart Card Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Contactless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Multi-factor authentication smart cards are available in two main types: contact and contactless. Contact smart cards require direct physical contact with a card reader for authentication. On the other hand, contactless smart cards use radio frequency identification (RFID) or near-field communication (NFC) technology to communicate wirelessly with a card reader, eliminating the need for physical contact. Both types provide added security by requiring multiple factors for authentication, such as something the user knows (password) and something the user has (smart card).</p></p>
