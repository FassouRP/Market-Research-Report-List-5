<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self Contained Breathing Apparatus Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-Circuit SCBA</li><li>Closed-Circuit SCBA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) are devices used by firefighters, industrial workers, and rescue personnel to provide breathing air in hazardous environments. There are two main types of SCBA: Open-Circuit and Closed-Circuit. Open-Circuit SCBA release exhaled air into the atmosphere, while Closed-Circuit SCBA recycle exhaled air by removing carbon dioxide and replenishing oxygen. Both types offer respiratory protection, but Closed-Circuit SCBA are typically used in more extreme conditions where air supply is limited.</p></p>
