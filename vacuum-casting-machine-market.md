<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Casting Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal</li><li>Non-centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vacuum casting machines come in two main types - centrifugal and non-centrifugal. Centrifugal vacuum casting machines use centrifugal force to force the molten metal into the mold, resulting in a more even distribution of the metal and a higher level of precision. Non-centrifugal vacuum casting machines, on the other hand, do not use centrifugal force and rely on gravity to fill the mold. This can result in a less uniform distribution of the metal but may be more suitable for certain types of casting projects.</p></p>
