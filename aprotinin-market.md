<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aprotinin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aprotinin (From bovine lung)</li><li>Recombinant Aprotinin</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aprotinin is a protease inhibitor commonly sourced from bovine lung tissue, used in medical and research settings. However, due to concerns over animal-derived products, a recombinant version of Aprotinin has been developed using biotechnology methods. The Recombinant Aprotinin market caters to those seeking a synthetic alternative to the bovine-derived version. Both types of Aprotinin serve the same purpose of inhibiting enzymes involved in blood clotting and inflammation, but the recombinant version offers a more sustainable and ethical option for consumers.</p></p>
