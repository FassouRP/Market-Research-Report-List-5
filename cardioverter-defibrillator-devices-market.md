<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardioverter Defibrillator Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator</li><li>External Cardioverter Defibrillator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardioverter Defibrillator Devices Market includes two main types: Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) and External Cardioverter Defibrillators. ICDs are surgically implanted devices that continuously monitor the heart rhythm and deliver electrical shocks to correct any dangerous abnormalities. External Cardioverter Defibrillators, on the other hand, are portable devices used in emergency situations to deliver electric shocks to the heart to stop dangerous arrhythmias. Both types play a crucial role in treating and preventing sudden cardiac arrest.</p></p>
