<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Vacuum Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Displacement Pumps</li><li>Momentum Transfer Pumps</li><li>Entrapment Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial vacuum pump market comprises of three main types: positive displacement pumps, momentum transfer pumps, and entrapment pumps. Positive displacement pumps work by trapping a fixed amount of gas and then reducing the volume to create a vacuum. Momentum transfer pumps use high-speed rotating blades or jets of gas to push air molecules out of the system. Entrapment pumps capture gas molecules by adsorption or condensation on a solid surface. Each type of pump is designed for specific applications and industries within the industrial vacuum pump market.</p></p>
