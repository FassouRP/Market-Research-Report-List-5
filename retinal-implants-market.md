<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Retinal Implants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Epiretinal Implants</li><li>Subretinal Implants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Retinal implants are devices used to restore vision in individuals with retinal degenerative diseases. There are two main types of retinal implants: epiretinal implants and subretinal implants. Epiretinal implants are placed on the surface of the retina and stimulate the remaining retinal cells to send visual signals to the brain. Subretinal implants are placed beneath the retina and directly stimulate the remaining retinal cells. Both types of implants aim to improve vision and quality of life for individuals with retinal degenerative diseases.</p></p>
