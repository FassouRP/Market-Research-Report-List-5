<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitrogen Generator Containers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Higher than 98%</li><li>Less than 98%</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Nitrogen generator containers are available in two main types based on the purity of nitrogen produced. Containers that produce nitrogen with a purity level higher than 98% are considered high purity generators, suitable for applications that require a clean and dry nitrogen supply, such as in the semiconductor industry. On the other hand, containers that produce nitrogen with a purity level less than 98% are more commonly used in industrial applications where a slightly lower purity level is acceptable.</p></p>
