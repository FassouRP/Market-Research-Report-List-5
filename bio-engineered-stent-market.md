<p><h1>Bio-engineered Stent Market Furnish Information about Market Size, Market Share, Market Dynamics, and Projections Spanning from 2024 to 2031.</h1></p><p><strong>Bio-engineered Stent Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>A bio-engineered stent is a small mesh tube used to treat narrow or weak arteries in the body by keeping them open. These stents are typically coated with materials that promote healing and reduce the risk of complications such as blood clots. Bio-engineered stents are designed to gradually dissolve in the body, eliminating the need for a permanent implant.</p><p>The bio-engineered stent market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.2% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to factors such as increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, advancements in bioengineering technology, and rising demand for minimally invasive procedures. Additionally, the development of bioresorbable stents that reduce the risk of long-term complications is driving market growth.</p><p>Some key trends in the bio-engineered stent market include the introduction of drug-eluting stents that release medication to prevent restenosis, and the development of bioresorbable scaffolds that provide temporary support to the artery before gradually dissolving. The market is also seeing increased investment in research and development to improve stent design and effectiveness. Overall, the bio-engineered stent market is poised for significant growth in the coming years.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bio-engineered Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metal-based Bio-engineered Stent</li><li>Polymer-based Bio-engineered Stent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bio-engineered stents are classified into two types: metal-based and polymer-based. Metal-based stents are made of materials like stainless steel, cobalt-chromium, or nickel-titanium that provide mechanical support to the blood vessels. They are known for their strength and durability. On the other hand, polymer-based stents are made of biodegradable or bioresorbable materials that gradually dissolve in the body over time. They are utilized to deliver drugs to prevent restenosis. Both types of stents are used in the treatment of coronary artery disease and are advancing the field of interventional cardiology.</p></p>
