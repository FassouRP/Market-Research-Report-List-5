<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Venipuncture Transilluminator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Infrared</li><li>Infrared Fluorescence</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Venipuncture transilluminators use different technologies for vein visualization, with two main types being Infrared and Infrared Fluorescence. Infrared transilluminators emit light in the infrared spectrum, which is absorbed by tissues and allows veins to appear dark against the surrounding tissue. Infrared Fluorescence transilluminators use a fluorescent dye that is injected into the bloodstream and emits light when exposed to infrared light, making veins glow and stand out. Both technologies aid healthcare professionals in locating veins for venipuncture procedures.</p></p>
