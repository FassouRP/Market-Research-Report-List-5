<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biogas Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Digestion</li><li>Dry Digestion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biogas systems can be classified into two main types: Wet Digestion and Dry Digestion. Wet digestion involves breaking down organic materials in a liquid slurry, typically in anaerobic digesters. This process is suitable for high-moisture feedstocks like manure and food waste. On the other hand, dry digestion systems process solid organic materials like crop residues and yard waste in an anaerobic environment. Both systems produce biogas which can be used for generating electricity, heat, or transportation fuel.</p></p>
