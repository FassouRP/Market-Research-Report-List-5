<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diaphragm Coupling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Diaphragm</li><li>Double Diaphragm</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diaphragm couplings are available in two main types: single diaphragm and double diaphragm. Single diaphragm couplings are simpler in design and are often used in applications where misalignment is minimal. Double diaphragm couplings, on the other hand, are more complex and can accommodate greater misalignment. The choice between these two types will depend on the specific requirements of the application, such as torque, speed, misalignment, and space constraints.</p></p>
