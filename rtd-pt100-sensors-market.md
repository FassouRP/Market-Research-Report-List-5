<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RTD (PT100) Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wire-Wound RTD</li><li>Thin Film RTD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>RTD (PT100) sensors are classified into two main types: wire-wound RTD and thin film RTD. Wire-wound RTDs are made by winding a platinum wire around a ceramic or glass core, allowing for higher accuracy and stability in temperature sensing. On the other hand, thin film RTDs are created by depositing a thin layer of platinum on a substrate, providing faster response times and better resistance to vibration. Both types of RTD sensors find applications in various industries such as automotive, aerospace, and HVAC for precise temperature measurement.</p></p>
