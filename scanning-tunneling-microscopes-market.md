<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Scanning Tunneling Microscopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Constant-Current Mode</li><li>Constant-Height Mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Constant-Current Mode and Constant-Height Mode are two types of scanning tunneling microscopes. In Constant-Current Mode, the current flowing through the tip-sample junction is kept constant. This mode allows for maintaining a consistent tunneling current by adjusting the tip-sample distance. On the other hand, in Constant-Height Mode, the tip-sample distance is kept constant while the tunneling current is allowed to vary. This mode is ideal for studying surface topography and atomic resolution imaging. Both modes offer unique advantages for different types of research and applications in the field of nanotechnology.</p></p>
