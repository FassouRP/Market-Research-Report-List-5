<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Embeddable Piezoelectric Accelerometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PE Type</li><li>IEPE Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PE type piezoelectric accelerometers are self-generating sensors that produce an output signal proportional to acceleration without needing external power. They are typically used in high temperature and high shock applications. On the other hand, IEPE type accelerometers require an external power source and a charge amplifier to convert the charge signal into a usable voltage signal. IEPE accelerometers are commonly used in vibration monitoring and analysis applications where a constant current power source is available.</p></p>
